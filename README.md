# IpTablesLayer7

This project was born on the basis of layer7protocols, to enable application-layer filtering, on recent firewall systems based on debian and iptables.

# Description 

## PatchFiles folder
### Kernel folder
This folder contains all the patch files to patch the kernel from version 2.6.8.1 to version 2.6.39.4.
In the future I will create patch files for kenerl 3.xx

These patches work very well, however, you may need to switch to smaller versions of GCC 4.8 like GCC 4.2 or GCC 4.6

### IpTables Folder
This folder contains the patch file for the iptables sources.
The patch files are fine for versions of iptables between the 1.3 and 1.4.20

## Protocols folder
### FileshareSites folder
This folder contains the protocols needed to filter the packets generated from file sharing sites like rapidshare.
These protocols have been developed entirely by me.
Soon it will put other.
